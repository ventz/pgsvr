pgsvr - Puppet Git Sync via REST
================================
Version: 0.0.3

This is a BETA - it works well currently, but it is FAR from complete.

NOTE: This requires an r10k setup with Puppet - without a CRON setup
(https://github.com/puppetlabs-operations/puppet-r10k)

Short Summary: This lets you configure a post-receive hook with your
git server/github that signals over REST so that an r10k run can
happen.

Alternatively, by changing one line - you can modify this to run
anything on your puppet server as the 'puppet' user when a signal hook
is received.


What is this?
-------------
If you are using puppet with git (github or your own server/repo), you
have realized really quickly that there are two 'hacky' ways to do it:
keep the git server/repo on the puppet server or glue some magic in
via SSH from the git server to the puppet server

####Partial Solution:
use r10k. You push your code to your git server, and the
r10k module on on your puppet master grabs it every X minutes (20 by
default, but you can configure it down to 1).

Still, that's NOT good enough! Can you imagine having to tell people
to wait a whole minute!

####Solution: PGSVR
you set it up on your puppet server, and you configure github (or any
git server) to have a post-receive hook that simply signals your
puppet server. This will initialize a r10k run.  Simple huh? Yep -
simple but effective.


PGSVR Components and Quick Summary:
-----------------------------------
This is rather simple.

* You need r10k - "dynamic puppet environments" tied into Git. Make sure that you don't setup the CRON, since it runs as "root"
* You need 2 perl modules (Dancer and Plack)
* An Apache server with a virtual config (I provide the site config)
* SUExec Apache Module
* A cgi-root (I create it under /var/www/pgsvr with the apache config)
to drop the app itself.
* Other than that, you need to unfortunately
change all of the r10k files to be owned by the 'puppet' user.
* Create some "tokens" and configure the proxy variables


To get it working, you need to:
-------------------------------
* Have a "dynamic git puppet environment"
You commit to git, and it picks up the branch and then creates the
appropriate puppet environment

Something like this in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf on the master:

    environment = master
    manifest    = $confdir/environments/$environment/manifests/site.pp
    modulepath  = $confdir/modules:$confdir/environments/$environment/modules:$confdir/environments/$environment/dist:$confdir/environments/$environment/site

* Install r10k (https://github.com/puppetlabs-operations/puppet-r10k)

Make sure you install it with:

    class { 'r10k':
        configfile => 'puppet:///modules/some-module/r10k.yaml',
    }
    # Comment out since it HAS to run by the 'puppet' user
    # or -- modify the code to deploy cron for puppet user.
    #include r10k::cron

* Locate every r10k file and chown to 'puppet':
locate r10k | grep -v 'etc' | xargs -L1 chown puppet

* Then chown of just /etc/r10k.yaml to 'puppet'

* /etc/puppet/environments need to be owned by 'puppet' and group by apache (www-data on ubuntu)

* Take the 'pgsvr' repo and grab the 'pgsvr' apache config, and
enable it as a virtual host. You will need Apache's mod 'suexec' (ubuntu: apache2-suexec)

* Take 'pgsvr' folder (inside the 'app' folder) and drop it in /var/www
You will need 2 Perl modules:
Dancer (ubuntu: libdancer-perl) -> REST framework in Perl
Plack (ubuntu: libplack-perl) -> Interface for Perl webapp to interface with Apache/other web servers

* Go into the /var/www/pgsvr/bin/app.pl and create yourself an 'user
and token' (see line about MD5 part). In reality, ANYTHING can be used
as a token. It's just used for a super rudimentary way of
"authenticating".

* Please set the $http_proxy and $https_proxy variables to '' if you
* don't need to use a proxy. This is used for pulling down modules from git and puppet forge


How to Test it:
---------------

* Make sure /etc/puppet/environments is empty
* You can 'curl' call your rest service: curl -i -H "Accept:
application/xml" http://puppet.domain.tld/sync/$user/$token

Where $user is the 'user' you created


TODO:
-----

* Create a rest call to read a file of users/tokens
* Create a config file for the http(s)-proxy variables
* Create real authentication
